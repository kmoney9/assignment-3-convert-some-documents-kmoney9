<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>I am writing to apply for a surf summer grant.I want to apply for this grant to do research on police on black male crimes. As a black male myself and I have been subject to a police on black male crime. I’ve also had friends that were a subject to it also.</p>
<p>My name is Kevin J Sails Jr I am from Tampa, Fl and I am a inspiration to kids and my community in my city. I am from West tampa and it’s a very poor place to live. There have been killings with police and black male crimes. Not only that but there have been incidents with police harassing black males in my community. Ive been in those types of incidents where I was harassed by a policeman and it is very scary to be put in that type of situation.</p>
<p>Every year there is crimes that police commit and don’t get charged for it throughout the world and throughout my city. I want to study how many crimes police commit on African American males And get away with it, then I want to bring it to the attention of the public so that we can do something about once I research on it. If I can do this research and bring it to the public there is a chance that the news can recognize this and make this a public problem throughout the US.</p>
<p>I Would love to thank you for your time and consideration if you need any further imformation please feel free to contact me at Kmoney@live.unc.edu or contact me @813-748-8626.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
